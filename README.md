# InsuCalc 

This application is an academic project created for a third year project course module. 

## Overview

InsuCalc is a tool created to assist type 1 diabetics who use manually injected insulin during meal times in calculating insulin doses. As an extension of this, InsuCalc also provides a simulation tool which shows the user, in a graphical form, how their blood glucose level will change over a period of several hours (typically to the next meal times ~4-5 hours). This simulator is built using LineGraphSeries.
